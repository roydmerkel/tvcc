PCE/ibmpc - IBM PC Emulator
==============================================================================

PCE/ibmpc is an IBM PC emulator. It emulates most (but see below) of the
hardware of an IBM PC 5150. The emulation is complete enough to boot DOS and
run most DOS applications.

Emulated parts:

Part		Status

CPU		An 8086/80186 emulator. The specific CPU model can be set
		to 8088, 8086, 80188 or 80186 at run time.

BIOS		An unmodified BIOS from an IBM PC or PC/XT is needed.

8237 DMAC	Supported, but not particularily useful yet

8250 UART	Supported

8253 PIT	Only counting modes 0, 2 and 3 are supported at this time

8255 PPI	Supported

8259 PIC	Supported

Sound		Not yet supported

Video		Supported video cards are: MDA, CGA, Plantronics ColorPlus,
		Wyse 700, HGC, EGA, VGA

EMS		Supported, with a custom DOS driver.

XMS		Supported, with a custom DOS driver.

Disks		Only supported through INT 13h at the moment.

Sound		Not yet supported.

Mouse		A Microsoft serial mouse is emulated.

Parallel Port	Partially supported. Output is written to a file.

Serial Port	Supported.


Configuration
==============================================================================

PCE/ibmpc is configured by means of a config file. A documented example config
file is installed in $(prefix)/etc/pce-ibmpc.cfg.


Running PCE/ibmpc
==============================================================================

After starting the emulator, pce is in command mode (unless the -r
option was used). Type 'h' to get a short summary of the available
commands.

The 'g' command starts the simulation. It can be interrupted by
pressing Ctrl-`.
