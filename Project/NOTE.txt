This directory contains the source code files for a special version of the PCE
emulator code designed to be split up into individual .DLL files for each
emulated system component, allowing the user to easily recompile, add, and
replace each one in the same way as in a real machine.

This project will eventually be merged into the main SoftMuseum code once it
becomes stable.
